Abastract: Abstract: Adaptive radiations provide powerful models to study the origins of phenotypic novelty and species diversity. Darwinâ€™s finches constitute a classic example in which beak morphology is a key trait related to fitness. Here, we focused on Camarhynchus tree finches, one of the most recent clades of the radiation, whose diversification remains poorly understood. We analysed whole genomes in combination with morphological data to revisit long-standing questions regarding their origins raised before genetic evidence became available. Camarhynchus diversified at least 100,000 kya, yielding striking morphological differences despite shallow genetic divergence. We identified seven highly differentiated loci, including G03, a supergene affecting beak and body size. By expanding our investigation to the entire radiation, we show that the small and large G03 alleles diverged early in the radiation, suggesting a key genetic innovation enabling ecological expansion. We further reveal a remarkable case of combinatorial speciation, where autosomal differentiation between a large tree finch lineage and the small tree finch is restricted primarily to a single locus -(G03)- that approaches fixation. Our results establish Camarhynchus as a model example of speciation with gene flow, underscoring the broader role of hybridization in generating biodiversity.
